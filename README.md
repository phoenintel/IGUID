## Join PhoenIntel
**To join the phoenintel organisation, you need to do the following:**
   - Generate an IGUID (Internal Globally Unique ID)
   - Attach a cover letter
   - Send everything in the contact form
   - he administration will reply by email in the next few days.

## The contact form and the GUID generator are available [here.](https://www.phoenintel.org/join.html)

**So, let's start step by step!**

## Generation of the Identifier

To become a member of Phoenintel, you must generate a unique identifier, called IGUID (Internal Globally Unique ID). This identifier will be your access key to our resources. Here's how to do it:

1. **Fill in the Required Information** :
   - Full Name
   - First Name
   - Desired Access Level (according to the categories defined, by default you should enter 5)
   - Date of Membership (in DD.MM.YY format)
   - Temporary Membership Status (Yes or No)

2. **GUID Generation** :
   Once you have filled in the necessary information, a unique identifier will be generated for you.

## GUID Generator

The GUID generator is available at the same page as the contact form.
 
 If this doesn't work, you'll need to download the GUID.py file from [this github repo](https://github.com/phoenintel/IGUID) to your computer and run it to generate your GUID.

## Composition of the GUID

Your identifier is made up of the following elements:

- **Hanging Number**: A unique random number.
- **Short Name** : The first few letters of your first and last name.
- **Country Code** : Your country code.
- **Level**: Your access level within the organisation.
- **Member Number**: Your membership number within the organisation.
- **Membership Date**: The date on which you joined Phoenintel.
- **Temporary Status**: Indicates whether you are a temporary member and, if so, the duration of your membership.
- **PIN Code**: A random code to secure your login.

## Sample GUID

Here is an example of a generated IGUID:

```
4846-3746-4747-LG-UK-5-17-31.10.23-N-4364
```

- **Hung Number**: 4846-3746-4747
- **Initials** : LG (L is the first letter of the surname and G is the first letter of the firstname)
- **Country code** : UK (member country code)
- **Level** : 5 (Organization Member)
- **Member Number**: 17 (17th member)
- **Membership Date**: 31.10.23 (31 October 2023)
- **Temporary Status** : N (Permanent Member)
- **PIN Code**: 4364

## Submitting your GUID

Once you have generated your IGUID, please check that all the information is correct. If there are any errors, please start the generation process again.

If everything is correct, send your generated ID via the contact form. Our administrators will check the information and register you in our database.

## Attach a cover letter

In the form, you will need to describe yourself briefly, possibly including a website or social link, so that we can understand who you are. Also write down your expectations and what motivates you at phoenintel. Be creative!

## And then?

The administration will reply via the e-mail address you have provided as soon as possible, i.e. within a few days. Depending on your application, if you are accepted as a member, we will send you further information by e-mail and your GUID will be entered in our database.
